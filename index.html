									<h2><a href="#">This is your <br />
									birthday website</a></h2>
									<p> As clear as the summer night's sky, <br> 
										Your personality is as beautiful as the stars behind the moutains, <br>
										And just as adventurous as a sailor in the sea, <br>
										Even in the darkest of space, you'll shine like stars. <br><br>
										
										
	
										This might be a little extra, but I wanted to make you this website for your birthday.
										I'm not good at arts and craft but I'm decent at coding. 
										I woudln't mind coding you something even after a CS Midterm, especially if it's your bday. Okay that's
										cringy because CS sucks but that's not the point. The point is, I'll do my best to be here for you and
										make you happy. I hope you enjoy my gifts and this. Below are some things I never told you during these events. Happy Birthday <3. #sanriosayshappybday.
